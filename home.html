  <h1>Flood and Hermann Fired After Disastrous Football Season at Rutgers</h1>
  <img src="http://newbrunswicktoday.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400xY/big10-leaders_2.jpg">
  <p>Rutgers University officially terminated head football coach Kyle Flood and athletic director Julie Hermann on November 29, in what the school's President termed "a day of change."</p>
  <p>Flood, the highest-paid employee at Rutgers, or any other state government agency, had found himself in hot water for inappropriately contacting a professor over a player's grades just two months earlier.</p>
  <p>Flood, the highest-paid employee at Rutgers, or any other state government agency, had found himself in hot water for inappropriately contacting a professor over a playtweetText"er's grades just two months earlier.</p>
  <p>The personnel changes come after a disastrous football season that saw several current and former Scarlet Knights players charged in a series of violent crimes, including an unprovoked assault on a stuent, and a string of armed home invasion robberies targeting marijuana dealers with guns, knives, and baseball bats.</p>
  <p>The shakeup also came just one day after the football team lost its final game of the season, dashing their longshot hopes of playing in a postseason bowl game.</p>
  <p>Unlike many people who might find themselves unemployed in the state, neither Flood nor Hermann appear to be in danger of falling on hard times.</p>
  <p>Flood is guaranteed to receive a $1.4 million payday, while Rutgers will continue to give Hermann $450,000 per year, along with pension and health benefits, for the next two and half years, or until she gets another job.</p>
